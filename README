Ruby termbox binding
===

- Get termbox source and compile. Newer versions may build the shared lib for you, else tweak the gcc command as necessary.
- See https://github.com/nsf/termbox/issues#issue/6 if on OSX (requires a tweak to termbox.c as of 2011-04-4)
- Install bundler && bundle install
- Edit sample/keyboard.rb and point Termbox.termbox_library_path to your shared lib.
- Run ruby sample/keyboard.rb to get a feel for what you can do. It's a partial port of termbox's own sample keyboard application.  (Ctrl + Q to quit)
